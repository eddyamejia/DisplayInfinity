So, I've divided libraries into 3 sections (For now).

1. Common (Libraries only depended on JS).
2. Web (Libraries can be used on web only).
3. Native (Libraries can used on react native).

## Common Libraries

- formik (Formik for tearless building form in any react).
- yup (Super easy form validator for Formik).
- react-intl (i18n.js support on any react ecosystem).
- lodash (Easy js utils for some common use cases).

## Web Libraries

- webpack

## Native Libraries
